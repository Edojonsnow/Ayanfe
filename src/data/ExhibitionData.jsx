    title: "SOLO EXHIBITION CURATED BY JULIELOLU",
    subtitle: "Now I know birds fly",
    content: `"Now I know why birds fly" serves as a journal of youthful reemergence with its tongue on the stream of life. It is a journal of recollections painted with the surreal signature motif of the artist's mind trying to make tangible the mental and visceral taste of life fleeting in time as it moves from one moment to the next. It includes works from paintings to drawings, art installation, sculpture, sound and fragrance installation, giving full sensory engagement to the viewers
    I'd like to say a huge thank you to @yinkabernie for his impact and collaboration on my sound installation at the gallery and @global_addict for collaborating with me on the fragrance installation. It was amazing
    Thank you all for making it count!
    Show runs till the 4th of June, 2022`,

    title: "GROUP EXHIBITION CURATED BY JULIELOLU",
    subtitle: "Unusual Suspects",
    content: `Dialects of 11 contemporary artists and looks for connections between contemporary and precolonial expressions. Image-makers from Africa and its diaspora connect through a non-linear timeline that draws inspiration from oral tradition, pre-colonial symbolic heritage, cultural symbols, fashion to twenty-first century's internet culture and personal iconographies. African artists assemble new and preexisting symbols to translate an ever-changing, multifaceted continent. This enables the realisation of a unique vernacular that conveys a fresh worldview.
        "Unusual Suspects" interrogates new expressions of gender and unfurls boundless African cultural identities. These new visual vernaculars encapsulate the historic and contemporary moment to create a language to express the limitless potential of the future. Symbolic interventions disrupt the accepted order of things and challenge the dominance of patriarchy. Unbridled confidence and imagination propel these artists to new soaring heights of self-expression.`,
